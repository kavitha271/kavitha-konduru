üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Kavitha Konduru

I‚Äôm a DevOps & Cloud Engineer passionate about building scalable infrastructure, automating deployments, and modernizing applications. I enjoy solving business challenges using Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud-native tools across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

üöÄ Featured Projects
## **Terraform Modules for Cloud Infrastructure**

Business Need: Standardize infra creation (VPCs, SQL DBs, VMs, OAuth secrets) across environments.

Solution: Built reusable Terraform modules for networking, databases, and secrets.

Tools: Terraform, GCP Secret Manager, AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GitHub Actions.

Highlight: Open-sourced modules that reduce setup time for new projects.

## **Health Record Management (Serverless ETL)**

Business Need: Automate ingestion & processing of health records (CSV, DOCX, Images ‚Üí PDF).

Solution: Designed a serverless ETL pipeline with AWS Lambda + Glue.

Tools: AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, S3, Terraform, Python.

Highlight: Secure and cost-efficient serverless workflow for healthcare data.

## **.NET Framework 4 ‚Üí .NET Core Modernization**

Business Need: Reduce licensing costs and modernize legacy .NET applications for scalability.

Solution: Migrated apps from Windows containers ‚Üí Linux containers using Porting Assistant + GeminiAI. Deployed on EKS, GKE, and AKS.

Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Dynatrace.

Highlight: Full CI/CD pipelines with end-to-end monitoring, and successful modernization of .NET workloads.

## **Anthos Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Management**

Managed Kubernetes clusters across AWS, GCP, and Azure using Anthos.

Enforced CIS Benchmarks and security policies with OPA Gatekeeper.

Implemented Istio service mesh for secure service-to-service communication.

Automated deployments via Kustomize + GitOps pipelines.

Unified monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Anthos Monitoring.

Impact: Delivered secure, compliant, and centrally managed multi-cloud clusters, reducing ops effort by 40%.

## **On-Prem Containerization & Portainer POC**

Business Need: Modernize legacy on-prem apps and reduce downtime.

Solution: Dockerized services, deployed on VMs, and introduced Portainer for container lifecycle & log monitoring.

Tools: Docker, Ansible, Portainer, GitHub Actions.

Highlight: Improved incident resolution using Portainer logs.

## **Docker-Compose ‚Üí Kubernetes Migration with GitOps**

Business Need: Scale apps beyond local docker-compose.

Solution: Converted apps to Kubernetes manifests, deployed with GitOps pipelines.

Tools: Kubernetes, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Grafana, Prometheus.

Highlight: Real-time monitoring dashboards for production workloads.

## **Vendor Management Platform (GCP App Engine)**

Business Need: Deploy & manage 10+ vendor-facing services across Dev, Demo, Prod, UAT.

Solution: Built a generic GitOps pipeline with environment-specific variables, using 4 GCP projects for isolation.

Tools: GCP App Engine, GitHub Actions, Terraform Modules, Secret Manager.

Highlight: Same codebase, multiple environments ‚Äî automated & consistent deployments.

## **DataIQ Self-Hosted Deployment**

Business Need: Run DataIQ in a custom hybrid infra instead of SaaS/cloud edition.

Solution: Self-hosted containerized DataIQ on Linux VMs, integrated with client‚Äôs infra.

Tools: Docker, Portainer, DataIQ, GitHub Actions.

Highlight: Enabled client-specific customizations & monitoring.

## **Open Source POC ‚Äì Nextcloud for ML Teams**

Business Need: Provide ML teams with secure, collaborative data storage.

Solution: Deployed Nextcloud on GCP VMs, managed with Portainer, for dataset storage & sharing.

Tools: Nextcloud, GCP VM, Portainer, Docker, Nginx.

Highlight: Gave ML engineers a self-service platform for training & collaboration.

## **SaaS Product Infrastructure (SAP + ML Integration on GCP & AWS) -KAI PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION**

Business Need: Support a SaaS product connecting SAP compliance data with ML-based classification models across GCP + AWS.

Solution:

Designed VPC peering & secure network architecture for SAP systems.

Automated multi-cloud infra with Terraform modules.

Implemented CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions with submodules for each microservice.

Automated deployments for ML models & SAP connectors.

Added observability with Prometheus, Grafana & Cloud Monitoring.

Wrote self-service playbooks & runbooks for SAP + ML teams.

Collaborated via Azure Boards for sprints & backlog tracking.

Challenges Solved:

‚úÖ SAP compliance ‚Üí solved with VPC Service Controls + secure peering.

‚úÖ Team conflicts ‚Üí solved with modular Terraform + CI/CD submodules.

‚úÖ Monitoring gaps ‚Üí solved with unified Grafana dashboards.

Outcome: Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes with automation.

Tools: Terraform, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana, Cloud Monitoring, Azure Boards, SAP Connectors.
